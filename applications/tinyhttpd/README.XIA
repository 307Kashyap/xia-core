This code has been modified to work with the XIA interposition wrapper. 

httpd can run as a normal sockets applicaton or an XIA app via use of the interposition library.
simpleclient will only run as an xia app due to how it was coded

To run under XIA, use the following commands:
xia-core/bin/xwrap ./httpd -x
xia-core/bin/xwrap ./simpleclient

Caveats:
simpleclient is a quick hack and doesn't look for end of file, it currently needs to be killed manually.
