The folder contains examples of the client-server
An ini configuration file is needed for the library.
The library looks for the XSOCKCONF environment variable
to find the ini file, but defaults to the
default ini file: xsockconf.ini.

The .ini file contains IP fields which need to be defined before
compiling. These fields depend on the IP of the fake interface.
The client and the server require different IP settings in
Xsocket.h for the loopback test, and are hence in different
folders.

To run the loopback test:
1. sudo userlevel/click conf/xia_chain_topology_socket.click
2. XIASocket/API/server/xs
3. XIASocket/API/client/xc
