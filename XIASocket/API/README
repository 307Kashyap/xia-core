Compile as:
gcc X*.c Server.c -o xs
OR
gcc X*.c Client.c -o xc
OR
gcc X*.c program.c -o output_filename

The folder contains examples of the client-server
Xsocket.h contains IP fields which need to be defined before
compiling. These fields depend on the IP of the fake interface.
The client and the server require different IP settings in
Xsocket.h for the loopback test, and are hence in different
folders.

To run the loopback test:
1. sudo userlevel/click conf/xia_chain_topology_socket.click
2. XIASocket/API/server/xs
3. XIASocket/API/client/xc
