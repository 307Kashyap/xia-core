Compile as:

gcc X* Server.c -o xs
OR
gcc X* Client.c -o xc
OR
gcc X* program.c -o output_filename

The loopback folder contains examples of the loopback test. 
Xsocket.h contains IP fields which need to be defined before 
compiling. These fields depend on the IP of the fake interface.
The client and the server require different IP settings in
Xsocket.h for the loopback test, and are hence in different 
folders.

To run the loopback test:
1. click click/conf/xsocket_loopback.click
2. XIASocket/API/loopback/server/xs
3. XIASocket/API/loopback/client/xc

TODO:
1. Make a Makefile
2. sendto and recvfrom aren't very useful, as DAG formats aren't 
   clear.
